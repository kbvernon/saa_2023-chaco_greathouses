::: {.notes}
The word 'agglomeration' is pedantic, a gerund that draws hoity-toity intellectuals to it like moths to a flame. But, it's also used a lot in urban and economic geography where it refers to "spatial clustering". Of course, in urban planning, it's just called 'density', so I guess, just call it what you want.  

Why should we care about this process? From the perspective of an archaeologist, the answer is surely that density is caught up in virtually every social process you can think of - from inequality to intensification to state formation. From the perspective of a citizen of the modern world, of course, the answer is that we can't let NIMBYs win. Building for density in cities is one of the most powerful tools we have for promoting sustainable development while also combating social and economic injustice, so understanding it, what causes it and what consequences it might have, is critically important from virtually every angle.

Monumental architecture, typically with one or more kivas surrounded by multi-story room blocks. They are also often found on prominent land forms and they are typically surrounded by dispersed pueblos or farms.

## Familiar hypotheses

2.  [**Agglomeration effects**]{.large}  
    Density offers üöö reduced transport costs, üë∑ available laborÔ∏è, and üß™ knowledge spill-overs  
:::

3.  [**But cities are costly, too!**]{.large}  
    More people means ü§º‚Äçcompetition for jobs, üìà higher rents, üç∑ expensive food, and üò¨ more people  
:::

::: {.notes}
Agglomeration effects = scaling effects that encourage density. 
:::

## Clustering is costly!

IFD tells us that habitat **suitability** is negative density dependent, so how do we get agglomeration effects?  

![](figures/cartoon-habitat-selection-01.png){.img0 width="70%" fig-align="center" style="margin-top:2em;"}

## Allee effects are unstable

Positive effects at low density are eventually overwhelmed by competition.  

![](figures/cartoon-habitat-selection-02.png){.img0 width="70%" fig-align="center" style="margin-top:2em;"}

## But, unequal effects may be self-reinforcing

Given circumscription, the productivity of an unequal system will increase *relative to alternative arrangements*.  

![](figures/cartoon-habitat-selection-03.png){.img0 width="70%" fig-align="center" style="margin-top:2em;"}

::: aside
See Wilson and Codding (2020) [The marginal utility of inequality](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12110-020-09383-4).
:::

::: {.notes}
The key here is circumscription. It guarantees that subordinates will always be worse off by choosing not to participate. At the same time, dominants will benefit from subordination. So the *relative* advantages of the whole system will tend to increase.  

In the context of a sedentary, food production economy, this process would be amplified as the opportunity costs of moving would already be really high.  
:::

## Co-regionalization  

Can explore this process by looking for times and places where great houses and pueblos co-occur.

Relative rate is ratio of observed to expected counts, estimated using a multivariate space-time model fit with INLA in R.  
Method described in G√≥mez-Rubio _et al_ (2019) [Bayesian joint spatio-temporal analysis of multiple diseases](https://raco.cat/index.php/SORT/article/view/356181).
:::

::: {.notes}
Values less than 1 mean observed counts are lower than expected. Values greater than 1 mean observed counts are greater than expected.

## Spatial random effects {.horizontal-center}

![](figures/spatial-random-effects.png){.img0 .mt-0 width="90%" fig-align="center"}

::: aside
Sum of shared and specific is total effect for each. 
:::

::: {.notes}

- Shared effect represents pattern irrespective of type.  
- Specific effects represent places that deviate from the shared effect.  
- So, there's just less of everything in the NE, and even less of great houses there.

:::

## Temporal random effects {.horizontal-center}

![](figures/temporal-random-effects.png){.img0 width="65%" fig-align="center" style="margin-top:3em;"}

::: aside
Sum of shared and specific is total effect for each. 
:::

::: {.notes}

- Shared effect represents pattern irrespective of type.  
- Specific effects represent times that deviate from the shared effect.  
- So, there's just less of everything before 900 and after 1300, 
- Slightly more of everything between those times,
- and even more great houses then.

## Covariance of spatio-temporal weights {.horizontal-center}

![](figures/covariance-of-weights.png){.img0 width="73%" fig-align="center" style="margin-top:1em;"}

::: aside
Weights are contribution of shared effect to relative rates of each.
:::

::: {.notes}

Positive covariance means times and places with more of everything also have more of each. Negative covariances means more of one and less of the other.

[Conclusion]{style="font-size: 2em; font-weight: 600;"}

1. Results are suggestive ü§î but inconclusive.  
2. Potential regional trends üåé need more consideration.  
2. Need to incorporate environmental covariates üå≥.  
2. And so many other things...
